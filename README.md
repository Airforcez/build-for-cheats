# build-for-cheats
random stuff i made (program with visuals that can check if game open or not, have also log in form
Password and username for login incase you dont find it: 
Username: trialuser
Password: 123456
(you can change these in button code here:

so after textBox1 == "trialuser" its username, change it to anything you want, and textBox2 == "123456" is password, if you wish me to make register option 10 stars because its hard :D
